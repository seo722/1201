        To date, astronomers have identified more than 3,900 “exoplanets”
        –worlds orbiting stars other than the sun. there’s a “hot Saturn” 260
        light-years from Earth that orbits its planet star so rapidly that a
        year there lasts less than three days. Circling another star 150
        light-years out is a “hot Jupiter,” whose upper atmosphere is being
        blown away by the star’s solar winds. Astronomers have also found five
        planets orbiting a pulsar—the remains of a once mighty star shrunk into
        an atomic city-size nucleus that spins. Some worlds have fallen into
        their suns. Others have been thrown out of their systems to become
        “floaters” that wander in eternal darkness.
